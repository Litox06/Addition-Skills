# Addition-Skills

### Addition-Skills is a single-page web application for 2nd graders to test their math addition skills.

The 2nd grader is prompted with an addition expression generated from a function with numbers ranging from 1-999, the 2nd grader will type his answer in the input box, hit submit so the application can receive his answer then the application will check if the answer is correct or not comparing it to the API's response (https://api.mathjs.org), if it is the application displays a "right answer" message, if it's not it displays a "wrong answer" message, in both cases the app renders another addition problem for the student to solve.
